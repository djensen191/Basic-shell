# Basic-shell
A C implementation of a basic UNIX like shell.

This project served as a good way to both learn about how a shell like Bash works.  It is very basic, handling the change directory command as a buil in (cd).
It also allows the user to use commands that are not built in using fork() and Exec(). 

This project is limited to the use of the c89 version of the C compiler.
